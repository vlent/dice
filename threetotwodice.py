# Using a throw of three dice to emulate a throw of two.
# Problem posed by Matt Parker during his
# Maths and Stats Society talk  at UWE (2016-04-07 Wed).
# Matt showed a toy with three dice in a transparant cube.
# He asked whether there would be a nice way to use a single
# throw of the three dice to emulate throwing two dice.
#
# I had a brief chat with Tarim after the talk.
# He suggested that if you could do two coloured dice, i.e.,
# two consective throws, then you can also do a single throw of
# two indistinguishable dice.
#
# The idea is to sort the values of the three dice,
# then map this to the range 0 to 35 and
# then map this to two values from 1 to 6
# (using dividend and remainder after division by 6).
# Each (1,1,1), ..., (6, 6, 6) has a 1/216 chance and maps to 0.
# (1,2,2) and (1,1,2) each have a 3/216 chance and map to the same value.
# Similarly other throws with two repeats are taken to be equivalent.
# All throws (excluding those with three repeats and taking into account
# the equivalency for the ones with two repeats) have a chance of 6/216
# and are numbered by consecutive integers.
